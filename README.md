## Challenge
Everyone loves going on Craigslist to find interesting people and interesting items. The joy of Craigslist is that it doesn't upgrade itself to stay up to date with the times - it's the same old Craigslist that everyone knows and loves. The core schema has also remained relatively unchanged over the years. Today, you will build a basic Craigslist CRUD app with nested routes. We will call this site: Craigslist Junior.

Users can:
  -create categories
  -create listings within those categories
  -upload images for the listing

  -display the categories
  -display the listings

  -delete categories
  -delete listings

  -edit listings
  -edit images
